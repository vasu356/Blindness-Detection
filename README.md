# Blindness Detection
 This project utilizes the APTOS 2019 dataset from Kaggle to develop a blindness detection model. Leveraging Python and Keras, it preprocesses and categorizes images of retinal scans into five classes based on the severity of diabetic retinopathy. The model employs a convolutional neural network, training on preprocessed images, and achieves high accuracy. The resulting model is saved and can predict the severity level of retinal scans accurately, aiding in early detection of diabetic retinopathy.
